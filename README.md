## 📌 Problem Statement

Airlines collect large volumes of customer feedback after every flight.  
However, converting this raw feedback into **actionable insights** is challenging.

### 🎯 Objective

Build an **industrial-grade machine learning system** that can:

- Predict whether a passenger is **Satisfied** or **Dissatisfied**
- Identify **key factors influencing satisfaction**
- Provide **transparent explanations** using SHAP
- Support **single and batch predictions**
- Be easily deployed and reused

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Kaggle (Invistico Airlines – anonymized)
- **Rows:** Passenger-level flight experiences
- **Features include:**
  - Demographics (Age, Gender)
  - Travel details (Class, Type of Travel, Distance)
  - Service ratings (Seat comfort, Food, Wi-Fi, etc.)
  - Delay information
- **Target:** `satisfaction`
  - `1` → Satisfied  
  - `0` → Dissatisfied

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand:

- Satisfaction distribution (class balance)
- Impact of service ratings on satisfaction
- Effect of departure and arrival delays
- Differences between business and personal travel

### 🔑 Key Observations

- Service-related features dominate satisfaction
- Long delays strongly correlate with dissatisfaction
- Business class passengers show higher satisfaction
- Loyal customers are significantly more satisfied

> 📒 EDA notebook available at: `notebooks/01_eda.ipynb`

## 🧠 Feature Engineering

Industry-standard feature engineering techniques were applied:

- Robust preprocessing using pipelines
- Handling of categorical and numerical features
- Delay-aware feature handling
- Train/inference-safe transformations

All transformations are stored inside a **single reusable feature pipeline**, ensuring
consistency between training and inference.

---

## 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation

Multiple models were trained and compared using consistent evaluation metrics to
ensure a fair and reliable selection process.

### 🔑 Key Explainability Insights

- Comfort and inflight experience are the **strongest drivers** of satisfaction
- Digital experience significantly affects customer perception
- Even moderate arrival delays drastically reduce satisfaction
- Service quality can partially offset delay-related dissatisfaction

These insights make the model **business-interpretable**, enabling data-driven service improvements.
